# chat-to-PDF System (Transformer + NLP Pipeline)

A lightweight **Talk-to-PDF AI system** built from scratch using core NLP components:

- Custom Tokenizer  
- Embedding Layer  
- Transformer Encoder (Multi-Head Self-Attention)  
- Masked Language Modeling (MLM)  
- PDF Text Extraction  
- Semantic Search over PDF Content  

This project demonstrates full understanding of tokenization, embeddings, attention, transformer encoders, and contextual prediction — similar to the BERT architecture.

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ 1. Upload & Read Any PDF  
The system extracts text from any PDF and splits it into manageable chunks.

### ✔ 2. Custom Tokenizer  
Converts text into integer sequences learned dynamically from the PDF.

### ✔ 3. Embedding Layer  
Maps tokens into continuous vectors + positional encoding.

### ✔ 4. Transformer Encoder  
Implements:
- Multi-Head Self-Attention  
- Feed Forward Networks  
- Layer Normalization + Residual Connections  

### ✔ 5. Masked Language Modeling (MLM)  
Demonstrates next-word prediction using masked tokens.

### ✔ 6. Talk-to-PDF Chat  
Ask questions about the PDF → system finds relevant chunks using embeddings.
